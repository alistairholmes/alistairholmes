### Hi there 👋

I am Alistair. Thanks for dropping by! I'm a Mobile App Developer that builds apps for businesses and individuals. I founded Sika App and currently serving as a Co-Organizer for [Flutter Zimbabwe](https://twitter.com/FlutterZimbabwe). Flutter is my go to framework when making different applications, however I also have experience in native development and a graduate of the Google Android Africa Scholarship program. You can find me at events like Hacktoberfest and ForLoop Zimbabwe (maybe at Flutter events soon😏).
